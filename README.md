# LP Finance Protocol

LP Finance is a decentralized synthetic asset protocol on Solana. LP Finance solves [Capital Inefficiency problems on stablecoin](lp-finance-protocol/overflow-reward-model.md) and introduces[ Typeless Repayment](lp-finance-protocol/typeless-repayment.md) to stabilize the value by providing arbitrage opportunities.

The protocol allows users to earn interest on supplied tokens and borrow USD and SOL pegged stablecoin interest-free.
