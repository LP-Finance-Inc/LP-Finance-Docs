# Stablecoin Capital Inefficiency

Most existing stablecoins (USDT, USDC, USDH, xUSD etc.) are backed by overcollateralized reserves. However, due to its capital inefficiency, algorithmic stablecoins like Terra USD (UST) are rising. To solve the capital inefficiency, the collateral in the reserve pool has to be liquid to earn staking rewards or interest. However, as the reserve should be overcollateralized, it is nearly impossible for reserve-backed stablecoin protocol to provide rewards to collateral suppliers.

To solve this issue, LP Finance designed an Overflow Reward Model, which allows excess collateral to be used for earning rewards.
