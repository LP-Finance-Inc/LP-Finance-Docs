1. User deposits collateral tokens to CBS Program
2. CBS Program Calculates USD value of the collateral
3. User can mint lpUSD or lpSOL up to 85% LTV

### **Shared Pool**

lpUSD and lpSOL are backed by a shared pool. This means the tokens in the CBS Program are backing both CBS. This allows users to borrow lpUSD and lpSOL at the same time without creating a new vault, which increases flexibility when taking loans.
